SkinScope iOS App Prototype
===========================

SkinScope is a native iOS app designed to help consumers quickly and easily research skincare products before puchasing. 

This app is a prototype. **[View the deck](http://www.slideshare.net/CarlaCrandall/skinscope-ios-app-process-annotated-designs)** for a full list of planned features and a preview of the UI.


### Dependencies

The SkinScope prototype uses the [Factual Global Products Database](http://www.factual.com/products/cpg) and [iOS SDK](https://github.com/Factual/factual-ios-sdk). To run the app you'll need to [request an API key](https://www.factual.com/api-keys/request) and add it to line 27 of *SkinScopeAppDelegate.m*.

SkinScope also uses the [ZBar iPhone SDK](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/iphone/sdkdoc/).
